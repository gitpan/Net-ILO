=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Net::ILO module is an interface to a subset of Hewlett-Packards 
Integrated Lights-Out out-of-band management system. HP's API is XML-based
and cumbersome to use; this module aims to simplify accessing 
the iLO from Perl while retaining as much functionality as possible.

Not every iLO function is implemented here, however most common ones are.

This module is based on the sixth edition of the "HP Integrated Lights-Out
Management Processor Scripting and Command Line Resource Guide" and has
been successfully tested with the following server types:

    DL360/G3
    DL360/G4
    DL360/G4p
    DL360/G5
    DL360/G6
    DL360/G7 ** see note below
    DL380/G3
    DL380/G4
    DL380/G5

It should work with other server models; feedback (either way) is much 
appreciated.

Note: iLO 3 support is in BETA, and still being tested.

=head1 INTERFACE QUIRKS

Wherever possible, I have mimicked HP's API to maintain consistency. However,
certain names have been changed to reflect a more common usage, for example,
what HP calls 'DNS_NAME' is referred to as 'hostname' by Net::ILO.

Boolean types are represented in the documentation as either 'Yes' or 'No'.
When ILO returns a boolean response, it is shortened to 'Y' or 'N'. Either form
is acceptable when passing a value to your server's iLO.

Power and UID statuses are an exception; their states can be either
'on' or 'off'.

=head1 METHODS 

The interface is extensive and methods have been grouped by function for
easier digestion.

=head2 GENERAL METHODS

=over

=item new()
    
    my $ilo = Net::ILO->new({
        address     => '192.168.131.185',
        username    => 'Administrator',
        password    => 'secret',
    });
    
Creates a new ILO object, but does not attempt a connection. Parameters
are passed as an anonymous hashref.
    
Required paramters: 

None, however trying to call any method without setting at least the 
address, username and password will fail. You may however, set these 
later using their associated methods if you want.
   
Optional parameters:
 
  address - hostname or IP of remote machine's iLO
     port - default is 443, you may specify another port here
 username - username for logging in to iLO
 password - password for logging in to iLO
  version - version of iLO API to use, '1', '2' or '3'. versions 1 and 2 are
            the same and correspond to iLO and iLO 2 respectively, if version
            '3' is used the module will use the new iLO 3 interface. if not
            specified the version will be detected automatically.

=item address()
    
    # connect to a different machine
    $ilo->address('192.168.131.186');

    print $ilo->power;

Returns or sets the address of the remote machine to connect to.

Please note that a lot of the data gathered (power state excluded) is cached.
Connecting to machine A, calling mac01(), then connecting to machine B and
calling mac01() will return the same data. It is recommended that you
instantiate a new object for each server you connect to. 

=item port()

    # your company's machines use a non-standard SSL port
    $ilo->port(447);
    
Returns or sets the port to connect to the remote server on.
Port 443 is assumed if not specified.

=item username()

    $ilo->username('jane_doe');

    # do some non-admin tasks
    # power-cycling machine requires elevated privileges

    $ilo->username('Administrator');
    $ilo->power('reset');    

Returns or sets the username to use when logging in.

=item password()

    # try both passwords, we forgot which one was good
    $ilo->password('foobar');

    # all methods return false on failure
    if (!$ilo->power) {

        $ilo->password('barfoo');

    }

Returns or sets the password to use when logging in.

=item error()

    $ilo->address('127.0.0.1');

    my $power_status = $ilo->power or die $ilo->error;

    Unable to establish SSL connection with 127.0.0.1:443 
    [IO::Socket::INET6 configuration failederror:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0)] at /somescript.pl line 14.

Returns the last error reported, if any. All methods return false when
an error is encountered, and $ilo->error is set to the error message
reported by the remote machine. Note that on success, error() is not cleared,
and so should not be used to determine whether an error occurred.

Every single method which interacts with the remote machine may throw an
error, so it is very important that you check to ensure the command
succeeded. Error checking has been omitted from most examples for brevity.

=head2 POWER MANAGEMENT

=over

=item power()

    my $power_status = $ilo->power;

    if ($power_status eq 'off') {

        $ilo->power('on');

    }
    else {

        $ilo->power('reset');

    }
    
Calling this method without parameters will return the current power
state of the machine, either 'on' or 'off'. Passing any of the following
to this method will attempt to change the power state:
    
    on
    off
    reset

=item power_consumption()

    # something like 340
    print $ilo->power_consumption;

Returns the current power consumption in watts.

This method is only available when using iLO 2 and above. Calling it on an
older machine will cause the following error to be returned:

Method not supported by this iLO version

=back

=head2 NETWORKING

=over

=item hostname

    # default is ILO0000000000 where 000... is your serial number
    my $machine_name = $ilo->hostname;

Returns the hostname of the remote machine. This is also the name shown
when logging in to the iLO interface, in the SSL cert, etc.

For information on changing the hostname, see the network() method.

=item domain_name()

    # maybe ilo.somecompany.net
    my $domain_name = $ilo->domain_name;
 
Returns the DNS domain name of the remote machine.

For information on changing the domain name, see the network() method.

=item dhcp_enabled()

    # either 'Y' or 'N'
    print $ilo->dhcp_enabled;
    
Returns 'Y' if DHCP is enabled for the iLO networking, and 'N' if a
static IP address is in use.

=item ip_address()

    # network dependent, something like 192.168.1.129
    print $ilo->ip_address;

Returns the IP address of the iLO processor. Note that the IP can NOT
be changed using this method. For managing network settings, see
network().

=item subnet_mask()

    # network dependent, something like 255.255.255.0
    print $ilo->subnet_mask;

Returns the subnet mask of the iLO processor.

=item gateway()

    # you guessed it, network dependent
    print $ilo->gateway;
    
Returns the default gateway in use for the iLO networking.

=item network()

    $ilo->network({
        name            => 'testbox01',
        domain_name     => 'mydomain.com',
        dhcp_enabled    => 'no',
        ip_address      => '192.168.128.10',
        subnet_mask     => '255.255.255.0',
        gateway         => '192.168.128.1',
    }) or die $ilo->error;
    
Allows you to modify the network configuration of the iLO processor. The
following parameters are allowed, see individual methods above for more detail:

    name
    domain_name
    dhcp_enabled
    ip_address
    subnet_mask
    gateway

If any parameter is not specified, current values are used.

Setting dhcp_enabled to 'yes' causes all IP related settings to have no effect.

If the IP address is changed here, address() is updated with the new information.

Networking changes cause the iLO processor to reset, it should become
available again within 30 seconds. 
   
The rationale behind seperate methods for viewing and changing network
settings is as follows:

Network configuration generally needs to be modified as a package, for
example, changing both the IP address and default gateway. Without a
separate method, calling the ip_address() method as a setter could
cause you to lose connectivity.

Changing the SSH port causes the iLO processor to reset, it should become
available again within about 30 seconds.

=item http_port()

    # default is 80
    print $ilo->http_port;

    $ilo->http_port(8000);

Returns or sets the port iLO's http service listens on. Valid port numbers
are between 0 and 65535.

Changing the HTTP port causes the iLO processor to reset, it should become
available again within about 30 seconds.

=item https_port()
   
    # default is 443 
    print $ilo->https_port;

    $ilo->https_port(554);

        username  => 'jbeam',
        password  => 'secret',
    });

Adds a user who will be able to log in to iLO via HTTPS, SSH, and any
other interface. When adding a non-admin user, passing in the parameter
admin => 'No' is also acceptable. 

=item mod_user()

    # change current user's password
    # in this case username is optional

    $ilo->mod_user({
        password => 'supersecret',
    });

    # this requires administrator privileges

    $ilo->mod_user({
        username => 'guest',
        password => 'changem3!',
    });
    
Method for modifying existing user accounts. Currently this method is
only able to change user's passwords; it cannot change permission
levels.

Passwords may consist of up to 39 printable characters. If you exceed
the maximum password length, an error to that effect will be returned.

If you update the current user's password the stored password used for
logging in will be updated automatically.

=item del_user()

    # you're fired!
    $ilo->del_user('jbeam');

Removes an existing user from the iLO.

=back

=head2 MISCELLANEOUS

=over

=item uid()

    if ($ilo->uid eq 'on') {

        $ilo->uid('off');

    }

Get the status of or control the machine's UID light.

Called without parameters simply returns the current status, either
'on' or 'off'.

You may pass values 'on' or 'off' to this method however be careful not to
set the uid light to on when it is currently on, and vice versa, as this
could throw an error, depending on iLO firmware version.

An error will be returned if you pass an invalid state.

    $ilo->uid('blinking') or die $ilo->error;

    State blinking is not valid at /somescript.pl line 13.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<User login name was not found>

General authentication error, eg. bad username or password when logging in.

Could also mean you attempted to change the settings (eg. password) for a 
user which doesn't exist

=item C<Method not supported by this iLO version>

Either your machine / iLO firmware version is too old, or the method you called
requires a more advanced license than you have.

=item C<State %s is not valid>

An invalid UID state was passed to uid(). Valid states are 'on' and 'off'.

=item C<Unable to establish SSL connection with %s:%d [%s]>

An error occurred while connecting to iLO. The message in brackets is
propagated from IO::Socket::SSL, and is rarely useful.

=item C<Error transmitting command to server>

A connection was established, but something went wrong while sending the
command to the remote iLO. Try reconnecting, and ensure that your
network settings are correct.

=item C<No response received from remote machine>

A connection was established and a command successfully sent to the iLO, but
no data was received. Again, ensure that your network settings are correct.

There could also be something wrong with the remote iLO management processor.
Troubleshooting is beyond the scope of this document.

=item C<Error parsing response: %s>

An error occurred while parsing the XML response from the iLO. The error
message is propagated from XML::Simple, and could mean HP changed the iLO
API.
